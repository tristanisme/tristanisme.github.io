            <h3 class="post-title">Productive learning holidays</h3>
            <span class="post-date">18 May 2016</span>
        </header>
        <p>I resigned. Told my boss to choose a date that would cause minimal disruption, and a few months later I
            was happily and intentionally unemployed. For the past 3 months I have been on a "learning holiday" to
            become a better programmer. Here's what I found made my time productive...</p>

        <h4>1) Have distinct modes: Planning, "Working" or Resting. Never mix.</h4>
        <p>
            Allocate some time to be in a particular mode and then focus. If you alt-tab from an IDE to Facebook, you're
            doing it wrong. Likewise, it's helpful to not be planning your work while also doing your work. Not only is
            it distracting, it can be discouraging because you'll second guess what you're working on.
        </p>

        <h4>2) Structured and unstructured planning</h4>
        <p>It's important to set and adjust goals. Do this by setting aside time to be in "structured" or "unstructured"
            planning mode.</p>
        <p>Structured planning is more goal focused. Should be done on paper. Write up the resulting plans somewhere you
            can see them every day, such as a whiteboard, window or mirror.</p>
        <p>Unstructured planning is more akin to brainstorming. Long walks are a good way to get thoughts pumping while
            looking after the body.</p>

        <h4>3) Don't look at job ads</h4>
        <p>Allocate a number of months to not even consider employment, or it will consume too much headspace.</p>

        <h4>4) Don't just read</h4>
        <p>After reading something, explain it to yourself. This'll ensure you understand it, and will help you
            remember.</p>
        <p>Although not appropriate for everything, I'm a huge fan of Anki. Basically it's software that lets do
            staggered
            self-testing with flash cards. It's efficient because it won't bug you with cards that you've recently got
            correct. Usually I write cards at home, and test myself on the train. An alternative app is SuperMemo.</p>
        <p>Supposedly there are studies that show people have strong biases against self-testing while studying, but
            that
            testing nevertheless greatly improves retention of both new and old knowledge. Citation needed.</p>

            <h3 class="post-title">WebRTC P2P CDN concerns</h3>
            <span class="post-date">20 April 2016</span>
        </header>
        <p>Using WebRTC to create P2P CDNs is an amazing idea that I believe has lots of potential. They push bandwidth
            costs on to the user, which could help poorly funded websites reach large audience. Nevertheless, here are
            two issues that I suspect will arise...</p>

        <h4>Surprise phone bills</h4>
        <p>There's no limit to how much your browser could upload. Website owners could even surreptitiously use traffic
            on one site to provide bandwidth for another.</p>
        <p>Example: Bob only reads fan-fiction on the train but receives a surprise phone bill for $1000. Meanwhile
            Alice watches cat videos on the train and never has to wait for buffering.</p>

        <h4>Privacy concerns</h4>
        <p>It will be possible to see the IPs of anyone visiting a website that uses a P2P CDN. This could be really bad
            if you happen to watch porn and live in Saudi Arabia, for example.</p>

            <h3 class="post-title">Programming Books</h3>
            <span class="post-date">15 April 2016</span>
        </header>
        <h4>YMMV / Humility Disclaimer:</h4>
        <p>Here are some programming-related ranked and rated by how useful I felt they were to me personally. The most
            important factor is usually how quickly I can obtain useful information from a book, rather than how much
            knowledge a book contains in total or how suited they are to someone else. Epic tomes like Donald Knuth's
            "The Art of Computer Programming" are awesome but not what I want.</p>

        <h4>Effective Java&nbsp; - Joshua Bloch - 9</h4>
        <p>To me, this book read like a thriller. For years I had been slowly developing my ideas about how to write
            neat Java code, gleaning pearls of wisdom from wherever I could find them. If only I had known that most
            those best practices were already gathered in this one book and explained in greater detail with
            clarity.</p>
        <p>The one downside is that it was last updated for Java 6. Everything in it is still relevant, but I would love
            to know Joshua Bloch's thoughts on Java 8.</p>

        <h4>Scalability Rules - M. Abbot, M. Fisher - 8</h4>
        <p>Excellent book. The authors were very focused on helping you zero in on what's relevant to you and skip the
            rest, and ensuring that all advice is concise and actionable. The book is structured around 50 general
            principles for building scalable websites, and they have indexes to show which principles tend to be
            relevant to which people (eg, software developers, project managers, etc). I ended up reading all of it, but
            I often still refer back to sections.</p>
        <p>Mostly the book has aged well, but HTTP/2 will make some of it obsolete.</p>

        <h4>Java Concurrency in Practice - Brian Goetz - 8</h4>
        <p>I've only read half so far, but I found this improved both my general understanding of concurrency with OO
            design as well as Java specifics. Could be denser in parts.</p>
        <p>Today I noticed the author has a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3553087/brian-goetz">Stack Overflow
            account</a>! I should read his answers. </p>
        <p>Edit: <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10202768/is-java-concurrency-in-practice-still-valid/10214606#10214606">Brian
            Goetz answering "Java Concurrency in Practice still valid?"</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>While my perspective may be biased, my current intention for updating the book would be almost
            strictly additive, covering fork-join, parallel decomposition, and the new parallel bulk data operations
            coming in Java SE 8.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>The Soul of a New Machine - Tracy Kidder - 7.5</h4>
        <p>This book is a non-fiction account of the development of a new computer in the 1970s, focusing on the
            experiences of the engineers involved. Apart from being thoroughly enjoyable, I think this book is useful to
            programmers because it explores many emotional issues a programmer must face. Building a system can easily
            become addictive and all-consuming. It's hard to resist pouring your entire self into a project, so it's
            worth considering what is gained and lost by doing so.</p>

        <h4>Patterns of Enterprise Architecture 7</h4>
        <p>A well structured book with lots of useful information. It's intended as reference and to provide an overview
            of what patterns are widely used, rather than to promote any single approach. Nevertheless, Martin's
            preferences (eg, Domain Models) are made very clear. I wish he wrote another book dedicated just to his way
            of doing things.</p>

        <h4>Founders at Work - Jessica Livingston - 7</h4>
        <p>A wonderful book for easy reading on a train. It's interesting to see how varied the stories behind succesful
            companies are, and how most of the founders were really fumbling their way through. The book also shows a
            wonderful collection of different ways people think.</p>

        <h4>Javascript Patterns - Stoyan Stefanov - 7</h4>
        <p>Need to revisit this book.</p>

        <h4>Javascript: The Good Parts - Douglas Crockford - 7</h4>
        <p>I like the central idea behind the book: Javascript has hairy bits to avoid and strengths to embrace. I need
            to revisit this book.</p>

        <h4>Thinking in Systems - Donella Meadows - 6.5</h4>
        <p>This book was an enjoyable read, but I haven't found myself applying its way of modeling systems anywhere.
            Sadly the author passed away before finishing it, and despite being subsequently edited it still feels
            incomplete.</p>

        <h4>The Clean Coder - Robert Martin - 6.5</h4>
        <p>The soft skills side of this book (eg, when and how to say "no") would have been more useful to me several
            years ago. That's not to say I don't have room for improvement.</p>
        <p>The book's confrontational tone, set by constantly asserting "<i>professionals use ___</i>", didn't gel with
            me because I believe friendlier ways to foster improvement are more productive.</p>

        <h4>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Robert Pirsig - 6.5</h4>
        <p>This book caught my attention because it was the only work of fiction on a list of top 100 books for
            programmers. The book is a number of things: the author's philosophy, a story about riding motorbikes across
            America, and the author's reflections on himself as a young man. I enjoyed it as a novel but the philosophy
            became too metaphysical for me half way through so I stopped reading.</p>

            <h3 class="post-title">Learning goals and how to choose them</h3>
            <span class="post-date">14 April 2016</span>
        </header>
        <p>As with anything in life, time spent learning has an opportunity cost. So what should a programmer focus on?
            "Follow your interests" isn't bad advice, but it's not helpful when everything is so damn interesting! Here
            are two criteria I chose narrow things down:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Learn skills with enduring usefulness.</li>
            <li>Learn skills that broaden your capabilities, rather than alternative ways to do the same thing.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With these in mind, I would like to focus on:</p>

        <h4>1) Java & the JVM</h4>
        <p>Everyone has their pet peeves about specifics of Java (e.g., the lack of optimised tail recursion) but it's
            hard
            to beat a language with such a massive community pumping out incredible libraries, tools, books, etc.</p>
        <p>Rather than learning how to achieve the same outcomes using an additional language, I'd rather deepen my
            understanding of Java and the JVM. Some experience with other languages can make you a stronger programmer,
            but I can mostly stick to the JVM with
            Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, and others.</p>

        <h4>2) Web standards and browsers</h4>
        <p>Frameworks come and go but web standards remain as building blocks. Understanding web standards broadens what
            you're able to build and allows you to be on the cutting edge of what's possible. For example, this talented
            guy
            uses WebRTC to run BitTorrent in the browser: https://github.com/feross</p>
        <p>There's also no getting around knowing Javascript, so you might as well embrace it.</p>

        <h4>3) Design principles and computing fundamentals</h4>
        <p>These tend not to be technology specific, or at least are related to technology that's deeply ingrained and
            unlikely to change. The Lindy Effect is relevant here.</p>

        <h4>4) Teamwork</h4>
        <p>Working with humans is core to almost everything. Will their mushy wet-ware become obsolete anytime soon? I
            don't think so, but if they do then all bets are off anyway.</p>
